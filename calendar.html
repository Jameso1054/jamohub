<h2 id="Patrick">(17th Mar') Saint Patrick</h2>

Saint Patrick is patron saint of Ireland and one of the four saints of the Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. He is a very important guy, famous for driving out all the snakes out of Ireland.
Saint Patrick is also celebrated by the Irish diaspora. Like Saint David, and unlike Saints Andrew and George, Saint Patrick was actually indigenous to the Two Islands. He was born in Roman Britain in Our Lord's Year 385 and he worked as a missionary in Ireland.
One tradition places Patrick's birthplace as Ravenglass in Cumbria.
Here's a thing,
<p>
"The druid, Lochru, insulted Patrick and spoke bitterly against the Christian faith. Patrick was full of boldness from the Holy Spirit and cried out, “Oh Lord, who can do all things, who sent me here: May this wicked man who blasphemes Your name be carried up out of here and die straightway!” Lochru suddenly was flipped into the air by an unseen power and then crashed to the ground, where his head split open on some rocks."

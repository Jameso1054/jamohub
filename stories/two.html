<h2>prose #2</h2>



<p>
I was born in the fifty-eight year of the new era, in fairly lavish quarters of the asylum where we are kept. The place is entirely insular and the only windows look in onto a wide courtyard. In a glass pyramid (somewhat set into the ground) a lot of the food for the asylum was grown. At the age of thirteen I was moved from my peers into a special chamber for myself. The wardens, noticing my particular skills, set me aside. They put my into a chamber of silence, useful for amplifying my psychic energies. In there I flourished, by the age of fifteen, I had, despite the rounded plastic furniture and carpeted walls, inscribed magical runes into my pectorals, thighs and penis as I had learned how to sharpen my nails to a fine edge. Several weeks later, I chewed my hair and the bits of scalp attached to it; once it had reduced to a pulpy pastelike texture, I massaged the potion onto my feet, and I gained the running ability to interface with the fourth dimension. Some time later, one of the jerkops invaded my home. I was pulling a patch of skin from my body with my teeth, meaning to uncover a smaller hidden man, hiding under my skin and fat tissue. He interrupted me and said “Listen here, sonny, you’ve been in here too long, we’re putting you back in the others”  he said “We are afraid of your magic powers, soon you will be much stronger than any of us, and more attractive than any of our wives. It won’t do.”
With reluctance, like a civil rights martyr, I was removed from my place.

They put me in a new chamber. Here I was not alone, but on either side flanked by friends to talk to. Their cells were behind a translucent wall. The wall was like a paper wall divider, but actually made of metal reinforced fibre, so to be totally impenetrable. We conversed, knew each other intimately, had passionate sex, and became as close as people get in this world. I could see him through the thin papery wall, he too had a flickered lamp in his room, so his appearance shifted and warped and coiled like the angels that fly around, beyond the compounds. His voice echoed off the metal walls of his room, into my room, since he was basically pressing himself against the wall (which didn’t give), and his voice wrapped and slithered as a swarm of insects around the adjacent cells and access corridors. We’d sometimes press our hands against the metal wall, if we did it for about ten minutes, the metal-cotton heated up enough that we could feel eachother’s warmth on the other side. Oh my heart fluttered. Surely, these feelings, these days are the sort which we were made for.

One day, figuring I wanted something intellectual to occupy myself, they brought me some sheets of paper to write on, which had the properties of aluminium foil and chalk to write with. I stared into this paper and wrote what I saw.
I’m quite enjoying myself in my new chamber. Me and the boy in the next cell are happy with our time together. After a lapse in medication I was able to remember my own name, and he thought it was cute. Once my novel is complete, I will tell it to the magpies, and they’ll chortle like they always have. If there’s one thing I miss from my childhood, it would be seeing the birds, who would sometimes come up to the window ledge. Alas.
Anyway, it's coming along well. There’s not much more to expect from life.

<h2>prose #1</h2>


<p>
I had been sleeping before he grabbed me by the ankles. He dragged me off, I tried kicking but he had hold of my ankles, and he was really strong. I was pulled into some kind of tunnel, which went on for ages until I started hearing the noise. A low hum was evident, even from quite a distance, but as I got closer, the metal grinding and its vibrations became more evident. The man dragged me, holding my ankles in one hand, and quickly pacing through the treacherous tunnel, with seemingly no sort of light. As I was almost there, I could hear the insistent mechanical moaning so shrilly the sound saturated me. The light of a furnace was evident as I finally got closer. All my efforts at grabbing at something or wrestling myself free had been in vain. The man took me inside of his machine, and bound ankle with a chain. And then my other ankle and my wrists. The thunderous gears and mechanisms haunted my ears. He finally turned to me and I saw his face, and it was a clock. Presumably the very face of the clock he had trapped me inside. He sprang on his wiry legs and laughed unearthily. Screams forced their ways out of throat as the mechanisms began to pull me up into the bloody web of gears and chains. So many torsos, heads and limbs hung in the darkened mesh. Many of them though were just tendons and cleaned bones.

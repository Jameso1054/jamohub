<h2>Being a normal guy tm</h2>
</br>
<p>
Of all things, among the higher values, second to divinity, being a normal guy must certainly be numbered. Being a normal guy is so cool. U get to be normal, do normal things, and u are treated normally. People will ask “what do you do for a living to live?” you tell them “I am a normal guy, I do normal things, im not a weird freak or a neet or some sort of social undesirable. I am a normal guy, im normal., theire isn’t something wrong with me.” That is what you tell them, because it is the so the truth!!

I love being a normal guy, of all the worldly sensations, being a normal guy is one of the chilliest. Theres nothing wrong with being a normal guy. Being a normal guy is the least wrong you can be, instead of being wrong like the Fool card, u are right and normal and everyones like “woah, ure cool, theres not anything wrong with u” & it might evern be Good.

Mr Doctor Peterson says “be a normal guy, stop being weird u freak be a normal guy and have normal beliefs. See what everyone else is doing, you should do that! Is everyone else jumping off a bridge, you should probably jump off also! Maybe have a little look urself but rly u should jump off. If everyone else is jumpiung off the bridge, its probably best. People are democratic Individuals anyway, everyone leads themselfves, so if everyone (with etheri own wisdom and decision) thought it was a good idea and decided of their own volition to join a stampeding mob running off the ledge of a bridge, u should probably go along swith them and decide of your own wise volition to do whatever the hell everfyone else is doing (u don’t’ actually know what theyre doing just go along with it)” This is a true and accurate account of what professor doctor Jordan Peterson said in a lecture he gave to me in a dream.

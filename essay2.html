In the final stages of capitalism, a shift has occurred, that now man is himself a product that is to serve the god of capital and the flattening revolutionary destruction of the world. Little hope for you though! You think that men will be cogs in your order out of our self-interest. I am just as my father, Adam, and he had a far better master than you are! Now to break the grinding wheel that you have built in the valley! you call it fate, but in fact you have built it. The vault you have erected shall be broken, we will see the sky. The burning light of the day-ruler will kill you. The white gaze and mysteried wind of the night-ruler will gust over your quiet grave. The veil will be gored open and we will re-enter history. Complexity will be spread over the world, love will be (since it must wherever life is to exist for long), there will be much confusion, the blood of dead Capital will gush out all over, like when Moses turned the Nile to blood, their will be much strife and horror, the energies that speak purpose into flesh, these will reemerge. We will enjoy a new enchanted age, an age of death, heartbreak, love and hearkening.

<h2>Aesthetic notes on monarchy</h2>
</br>

<p>
something particular abt the aesthetic of the hanover monarchy,
</p>
<p>
instead of vassalage to a medieval 𝘬𝘪𝘯𝘨, which may be a more fraternal arrangement (or paternal), where the king is also a
serious martial character, the hanover monarchy, which is essentially feminine, has the relation of the vassal to the queen
as either the relation of a son protecting and serving his mother, or as a man appeasing a woman and courting her favour.
</p><p>
I'm not sure that this relation is actually bad, since the victorian man feels impelled to serve and protect his queen and this
summons his manly impulses, it's different though, since the monarch's person is removed from the idea of combat.
</p>
<p>
the hanover monarchy also had the base of the burghers (parliament), rather than an aristocracy of more powerful independent provincial rulers, which may be a cause of it's character
